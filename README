==========================
Prefetch Experiment Client
==========================

OVERVIEW

This project contains a CXF client configuration for the Prefetch Experiment Server.

This client & server were created for the purpose of exploring the affect of "prefetch"
on SOAP over JMS infrastructures.  It was quickly discovered that a prefetch of 0 is
prefered to mimimize the affects of processing latency on message distribution and to
allow for more evenly distributed processing accross consumers.

After that was determined, a decision was made to utilize the project to compare the 
performance of HTTP and JMS SOAP Transports.
